  <h3>Thoughts on "Code Reads #12: “Big Ball of Mud”"</h3>
  <p>To be honest, this post worried me to some extent. I don't want to fall into the trap of having messy and unreadable code that barely functions. If there's a problem with
    that type of code, it seems like a nightmare to fix it. I'd like to get into the habit of being a clean developer as I continue learning, but I am sure that is easier said
    that done. As the article pointed out, it's far easier to slap something together and get it out the door than spent months or years longer creating something beautiful
    and perfect. This post eludes to the fact that there are an almost infinite amount of ways to approach a problem in programming, each with advantages and disadvantages to
    each other.

  <h3>DevOps Summary</h3>
  <p>DevOps is an incarnation of agile software development, born from the need to keep up with the increased software velocity. As software development has evolved, there was 
    a need for a new and improved approach to the development cycle, being DevOps. The goal of DevOps is to improve deployment frequency, achieve faster time-to-market, attain 
    lower failure rates, shorten time between fixes, and improve software recovery time. The method attempts to put the customer first and foremost in the development process.
    DevOps accomplishes this by dividing the cycle of development into six different phases- thinking, coding, delivery, running , managing, and learning phase. This process
    cuts down on slowdowns in the workplace and greatly improves general efficiency, increasing the speed of which new applications can be released and existing applications
    can be modified. DevSpecOps is the concept of integrating application security testing with a DevOps environment without hindering the process speed too much. The use of 
    application security gates- Development QA and security- allows organiations to inject seamless security testing throughout the software development cycle. With this mehtod, 
    organizations can minimize application vulnerabilities and risk. All in all, DevOps is an efficient programming environment and process for teams working on all kinds of
    projects. It makes the chaos of development a good bit less chaotic.

    <h3>Thoughts on "Inevitible Pain"</h3>
    <p>
    This piece leaves me with mixed feelings. At this point, it feels like I'm walking through empty echochambers with remnants of programming challenges scattered everywhere,
    trying to even begin to comprehend what has worked for previous projects and what hasn't. Maybe one day in the far, far distant future I'll catch up to the herd, but as of
    right now, it is interesting to read what 'has' and what hasn't worked for other programmers. It seems no method truly works perfectly, they just operate better than others.
    Each of the methods mentioned in the article is noted to be "lead bullet", in the sense that there can never be a "silver bullet" method to programming.

    <h3>"Software is Hard" takeaway</h3>
    <p>Software always makes itself out to be an unruly beast that no programming team can ever fully tame, just control for a little while to get a little closer to a desired
      output. But it has to be that way. It is perhaps the most complex endeavor humanity has ever undertaken. The complexity of software is essential to its functionality. If 
      programming wasn't so insanely intricate, software would never have the extreme functionality we are so well acquainted with nowadays. The only way to make software easier
      is to make it harder. One day, overbudget and decades late, maybe we will have made a super AI that can program infinitely complex programs in an infinitesimally small amount
      of time, something that would take us pea-brains by comparison centuries. Until that point, I gather that projects will continue to be painstakingly slow and frustrating
      projects with diminishing returns until the end.
